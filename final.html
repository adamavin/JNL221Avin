			<p> Florida might be called the sunshine state, but is no stranger to natural disasters, like hurricanes. Hurricanes are considered to be “major” if they have sustained winds of 110 miles per hour or greater, and pose significant threats to the state and its residents. Since 2017, there has been 5 major hurricanes. So, recently, the frequency and intensity of these storms have raised concerns from Florida citizens. <br>

				<br> Major hurricanes are a category onto themselves, capable of leaving a trail of destruction in their path. Avi Swartzon and his family have lived in South Florida for 50 years, and have been through plenty of hurricanes, but nothing like what they went through with Hurricane Andrew in 1992. <br> 

				<br> “It was a very stressful time. We had pets, our son was 12 years old. We hid in the bathroom for hours since there were no windows… the wind sounded like a train going by the house,” said Swartzon. “When the noise stopped and we opened the door… 27 windows were shattered, the roof had collapsed, and rain destroyed the house. Because of the stress and damage, we had to move to another house.” <br> 

				<br> With the unpredictable nature of hurricanes, staying ahead of the curve in terms of knowledge is very important to minimize the impact they can inflict on the state and its communities. <br>

			<h3>The Devastating Aftermath of Major Hurricanes</h3>
			<p>When a major hurricane makes landfall in Florida, the consequences are often catastrophic. The torrential downpour and strong winds can lead to widespread flooding, structural damage, and power outages. Coastal areas are particularly vulnerable, with storm surges posing a direct threat to homes and businesses. <br>

<br> The economic toll is significant, with billions of dollars required to repair everything and support those affected, both individuals and families. Dating back over 100 years, since major hurricanes started to be tracked, they’ve caused over $310 billion in damages, with over $137 billion coming from Category 5’s alone. <br>

<br> The aftermath of a major hurricane is a difficult one. Floridians come together to rebuild their communities, but the process is often prolonged and traumatizing. <br>

			<h3>Global Warming's Influence</h3>
			<p>The discussion surrounding global warming has added a new layer to the challenges posed by major hurricanes in Florida. As sea surface temperatures rise, hurricanes gain energy and intensity, leading to more powerful and destructive storms. <br>

<br> In an article from the Environmental Defense Fund, Senior Climate Scientist Ilissa Ocko says that Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are the leading cause of global warming, and the reality is that Florida is one of the top greenhouse gas-emitting states. <br>

<br> Florida needs to stop contributing to global warming to make sure hurricanes do not get rapidly worse, and the damage isn’t catastrophic. As Florida faces the reality of more frequent and severe hurricanes, policymakers and scientists must collaborate to implement sustainable practices and mitigate the impact of these major hurricanes. <br>
